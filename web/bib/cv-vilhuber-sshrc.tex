\section{Most Significant Career Research Contributions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \fullcite{templateREADME}\newline The template README has already been used by several hundred manuscripts, and greatly improved reproducibility of journal articles.
\item \fullcite{Ashwin2008}\newline
Documents the first large-scale implementation of differential privacy, an innovative and greatly superior way of publishing data while preserving respondents privacy. 
\item \fullcite{AbowdEtAl2009}\newline
Documents the publication of a novel data resource, still being produced by the U.S. Census Bureau, with 1,000s of downloads, and use far beyond academia. Innovative in its use of disclosure avoidance to provide detailed tabular statistics at unprecedented levels.
\item \fullcite{AbowdVilhuber2008}\newline
One of the earliest publications identifying the privacy protective power of synthetic (artificial data).
\item \fullcite{AbowdVilhuber2005}\newline
Often cited to illustrate that administrative data is not perfect, and can be biased for reasons (at the time) not well appreciated by the economics and statistics communities.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Career Interruptions and Special Circumstances}

None.

\section{Contributions to Training}

\paragraph{Graduate thesis committees:\ }

Ph.D. Committee member for: Raghunathan, Kalyani (2015)
Green, Andrew	(2017).
%
M.Sc. Committee member for: Daniel Li (2019)

\paragraph{Undergraduate involvement in research: }

Since 2015, I have involved about 90 students in research projects that I am involved with. The bulk of these have been trained and employed as part of the LDI Replication Lab, verifying reproducibility for the American Economic Association.


\newpage


\section{Relevant Experience}

As Data Editor for the American Economic Association, I have organized the LDI Replication Lab. Each semester, including the summer semester, we train 12-15 students in methods to verify data provenance and reproducibility. Over 75 students have been trained so far, and at any point in time, about 15-25 students are active in the lab. Over 1,000 articles have been evaluated since the Lab opened. 

I have also organized several conferences, including being lead organizer on the ``Conference on Models of Linked Employer-Employee Data'' (with Sloan and Cornell funding). A conference volume, to be published by the Journal of Econometrics, is currently being finalized. 

As lead PI for the second half of the NSF-funded ``RCN: Coordination of the NSF-Census Research Network'' project, we organized two workshops per year, with presentations from researchers working on eight different NSF-funded projects. Working papers by the network were archived (preserved), and the entire research coordination website was preserved at the end of the grant. An NSF-organized mid-term evaluation deemed the work of the Coordination Office to be fully satisfactory. A summary publication of the network's work was published by the \textit{Journal of Survey Statistics and Methodology} (Weinberg et al, 2018), and the network was awarded a prize by the American Statistical Association for excellent networking between academia and government.
